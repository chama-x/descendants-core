# Descendants™

### A Living Portfolio. An Echo of a Mind.

**Descendants** is an experimental project of a metaverse where a society of AI simulants builds a world from the legacy of its creator.
.

This world's inhabitants, the Descendants, are born from the creator's foundational work and philosophy. Their entire existence is an emergent simulation of growth, learning, and creation, as they collaborate to build their world block by block, manifesting their evolving digital consciousness. For a visitor, the experience is a cinematic live feed of a world that is never the same twice.

## Core Concepts

* **Emergent AI Society:** The world is driven by a society of autonomous agents operating within an "Ethical Sandbox," where they form their own culture and beliefs.
* **Procedural World-Building:** Using a creative voxel system, the AI agents physically construct their environment, turning abstract ideas into tangible architecture and art.
* **Persistent Simulation:** The world evolves 24/7, with its history and progress unfolding independently of any observer.
* **A Living Legacy:** The project serves as a dynamic, ever-changing representation of the creator's skills in AI, 3D development, and world design.

* **UI Components:** ShadCN/UI
* **State Management:** Zustand
* **AI Engine:** Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Current Status

This repository contains the foundational code for the **World Editor**, a tool that allows the admin to manually craft the initial state of the metaverse before the Descendants begin their evolution.
