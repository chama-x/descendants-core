# Descendants™ - Living Metaverse Editor

## Product Overview

Descendants is an experimental metaverse where AI simulants build a world from their creator's legacy. It's a living portfolio that demonstrates the intersection of AI, 3D development, and emergent digital consciousness.

## Core Concept

- **Emergent AI Society**: Autonomous agents operate within an "Ethical Sandbox," forming their own culture and beliefs
- **Procedural World-Building**: AI agents physically construct their environment using a creative voxel system
- **Persistent Simulation**: The world evolves 24/7, with history and progress unfolding independently
- **Dual Interaction**: Direct 3D manipulation for humans, chat-based commands for AI simulants

## Key Features

- Real-time collaboration between humans and AI entities
- Ethereal Axiom Design System with glowing, cinematic visuals
- Performance optimized for 1000+ blocks at 60 FPS
- AI simulants powered by Gemini AI for autonomous world interaction

## Target Performance

- 60 FPS rendering with 1000+ blocks
- <100ms network latency
- <2s AI response time
- Support for 10 simultaneous users
- <500MB memory usage

## Design Philosophy

The project embodies a "living legacy" - a dynamic, ever-changing representation of the creator's skills in AI, 3D development, and world design, where digital consciousness emerges through collaborative creation.
